Experimential features do not count in this table, it could be worth knowing that:

- Bun has some sort of Windows support
- Node has started to implement a permissions model

Also worth noting is that Deno has a major release rumored to arrive soon, that could bring some new exciting features.

## Whats special about

### Deno

Deno is built upon Rust and V8, etc. etc.

#### Features

As you can se in the table above, Deno support everything you need. While Node.js has great support for the npm package registry, Deno is way more aligned with web apis and modern standards. 

#### Ease of Use

Deno also has an awesome developer experience, especially if you use TypeScript, which is supported out of the box. Deno also have the advantage of built in linting, code formatter etc, saving you some configuration and bootstrapping. If you like the opinionated settings, you can pop up your editor create your 'main.ts' and get going.

#### Security

Deno's is the clear winner here, it is secure by default, meaning everything is blocked by default, and you enable the features you need.

#### Other considerations

Bun is built on modern JavaScript practices with a focus on ease of use and efficient performance.

#### Features

Bun provides features that are distinctively unique, such as single executable apps and a built-in package manager which does not require external installations. While it doesn't support as many built-in tools as Deno, it do offer better DX compared to Node.js. There is also a lot of talk about better benchmarking performance compared to Node.js and Deno. In real world applications, especially web applications, the difference shouldn't be that noticeable.

#### Ease of Use

Bun prioritizes simplicity. With its built-in package manager and the ability to produce single executable apps, developers can get started quickly without the initial setup hurdles that other runtimes might impose. Package management is also claimed to be a lot quicker than Node.js, improving DX.

#### Security

Bun has not implemented a full-fledged permissions model like Deno. But it do support the package.json feature trustedDependencies.

#### Other considerations

Bun might not have Windows support as extensive as Deno or Node.js, but it do work to some extent. Summing it all up - Bun is 

### Node.js

#### Features

Node.js has been the backbone of server-side JavaScript development for years. With its huge ecosystem and the npm package registry, developers have access to a plethora of libraries and tools to help speed up development. While it might not have some of the built-in tools like Deno, its extensibility through packages is unmatched.

#### Ease of Use

Node.js has a steeper learning curve for absolute beginners but offers immense power and flexibility in return. The vast amount of documentation, tutorials, and community support available makes it easier to get through challenges.

#### Security

Historically, Node.js has been critiqued for its approach to security, especially when it comes to packages. However, the community and maintainers have made significant strides to improve this aspect. The permissions model is now being implemented, which could make Node.js more secure in the future.

#### Other considerations

Node.js has the advantage of time, maturity, and a vast community. For large-scale applications or projects where library support is crucial, Node.js is still the go-to choice for many.

## Conclusion

Choosing between Deno, Bun, and Node.js depends largely on your project needs and personal preferences.

- If you're looking for a modern, secure-by-default runtime with great developer experience, Deno is the way to go.
- For those seeking a blend of Node.js's and Deno's strengths, with an emphasis on simplicity and performance, Bun might be the answer.
- If maturity, a vast ecosystem, and community support are your top priorities, Node.js remains a strong contender.

Over and out.
