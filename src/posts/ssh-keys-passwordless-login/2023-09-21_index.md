intro: "SSH keys are cryptographic keys that enable user authentication to servers, providing a secure alternative to traditional passwords. They not only increase security but also greatly simplify daily tasks for developers."

By employing an SSH key, you can:

- Elevate the security of your environment by disabling regular password access
  and mandating a passphrase-protected SSH key.

- Streamline your login process by either eliminating the need for a password or
  opting for a passphrase simpler than those typically necessary for secure SSH
  logins, although it's crucial to note that this isnâ€™t a best practice and
  should be reserved for less critical setups, such as personal home networks.

Moreover, platforms like Visual Studio Code and GitHub support remote SSH
sessions using key authentication, ensuring secure and seamless remote coding
experiences.

This introduction is a gateway to a series focused on SSH keys. Below is a quick
guide containing essential commands to generate and use SSH keys swiftly. For
those interested in diving deeper into the details, refer to
[Creating SSH Keys](/posts/ssh-keys-passwordless-login/generate-ssh-key/) which
is the next article in this series.

## Quick Start: Generate an SSH Key

**Linux/MacOS**:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

**Windows (PowerShell as administrator)**:

```bash
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client
Get-Service -Name ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Automatic
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

Press `Enter` for default settings and decide whether to set a passphrase.

### Start SSH Agent & Add Your Key

**Linux/MacOS**:

```bash
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

**Windows**:

```bash
Start-Service ssh-agent
ssh-add ~\.ssh\id_rsa
```

### Distribute the Public Key to the Remote Server

For a server with the address `your_server_ip`:

**Linux**:

```bash
ssh-copy-id username@your_server_ip
```

**Windows using Powershell**:

`type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | ssh user@host "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"`

**Manually**:

Append the public key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) content to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
on the server.

### Test SSH Connection

```bash
ssh username@your_server_ip
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to log into the server
without entering a password.

### (Optional) Disable Password Authentication on Server

After ensuring that the SSH key-based access is successful:

1. Edit the SSH configuration:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

2. Change the line `#PasswordAuthentication yes` to:

```bash
PasswordAuthentication no
```

3. Restart the SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### (Optional) Use with GitHub

- Copy the public key content:

  **Linux**: `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | xclip -selection clipboard`

  **Windows (Git Bash)**: `clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

  **Windows (Powershell)**: `Get-Content ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | Set-Clipboard`

- Go to GitHub account settings > "SSH and GPG keys" > "New SSH key". Paste the
  copied key and save.

That's it! You've quickly set up SSH key management for both remote server
access and GitHub. Adjust and dive deeper into the configurations as needed
using the information provided in the upcoming sections.
