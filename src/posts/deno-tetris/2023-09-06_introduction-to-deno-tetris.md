## What's Tetris?

Tetris is a classic video game where you stack different shapes made of four
blocks. The goal is to form complete lines, which then disappear, giving you
points. The game gets faster as you go along, making it a fun challenge!

## Why Deno?

Deno is a JavaScript and TypeScript runtime, kinda like Node.js. But it has some
cool features like better security and a built-in package manager. We chose Deno
for this project because it's modern and super easy to use.

Detris is not just any Tetris clone. It's got:

- **Single-Player Mode**: For practicing or just for fun
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Challenge your friends online
