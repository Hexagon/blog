title: Conclusion and Future Enhancements
part: 7
intro: "Welcome to the grand finale of our Detris series, where we've been guiding you through the creation of a full-featured Tetris game using Deno."
---

## Starting the game

Now you have a complete Tetris game, start the server using Deno. The
`--unstable` flag is required as Deno KV is not yet stabilized:

`deno run -A --unstable main.ts`

Check out the
[Detris GitHub repository](https://github.com/Hexagon/detris/blob/main/README.md),
create an issue, or leave a comment below this article if you have any problems
or feedback!

## What We've Built

Congrats, you've made it to the end of the series! Let's recap what we've built:

- A web-based Tetris game using Deno
- Single-player mode with server-side calculations
- Additional multiplayer modes, Co-Op and Battle
- Basic AI opponents

## Wrapping Up

Thanks for following along! We hope you enjoyed this series and learned
something new. Now go ahead and build your own awesome version of Tetris!

See you in the next project!
