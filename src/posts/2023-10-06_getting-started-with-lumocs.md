intro: "Meet **Lumocs**, a documentation generator powered by JavaScript through Deno and Lume. This guide will walk you through the essential steps to set it up, create
your first documentation page, and deploy your site.


If you want a quick showcase, check out the [Lumocs Documentation](https://lumocs.56k.guru), which is generated by Lumocs itself."

**Features**

- Design and layout **tailored for documentation**.
- Automatic light/**dark mode** by user preference.
- **No configuration** needed, **works great and looks great** out of the box.
- Generates a documentation website from **markdown**-files, using extended
  `markdown-it` syntax.
- **Easy to customize** using `_data.json` and the `_includes`-folder.
- Mobile-**responsive design**.
- Ready for deployment on **GitHub Pages**.
- **Hierarchical navigation** with up to three content levels.
- Built with **modern tools**: Deno and Lume.

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into Lumocs, ensure you have Deno installed on your system.
Lumocs requires Deno version 1.37 or higher to function correctly. If you
haven't installed Deno yet, follow the
[official instructions](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation)
to get it up and running. If you're new to Deno and want to learn more about its
features, you can also check out my post on
[Getting Started with Deno](https://hexagon.56k.guru/posts/getting-started-with-deno/).

## Fast Track Setup

If you're eager to get started quickly with Lumocs, you can use the following
command to initialize your Lumocs project:

```sh
deno run -A https://deno.land/x/lumocs/init.ts <folder-name>
```

Replace `<folder-name>` with the name of the folder where you want to set up
your Lumocs project. This command will create the basic project structure and
essential files. Enter the newly generated folder and run:

```sh
deno task serve
```

This will launch a local server, making your site accessible at
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## The Details

While the initialization script above creates all the necessary files
automatically, if you prefer a manual setup, here's how to organize your Lumocs
project files effectively:

```
/                          # Your repository root
├── /docs                  # The documentation folder
│   ├── _config.ts         # Lume configuration file
│   ├── deno.json          # Deno configuration file
│   └── /src               # Documentation source
│       ├── _data.json     # Global variables
│       ├── index.md       # Documentation index, will become index.html
│       └── <other pages>  # Additional documentation pages
```

In this structure, all Lumocs-related files are placed within the `/docs`
subfolder. The actual content and global variables are located in the
`/docs/src` subfolder.

### `deno.json`

The `deno.json` file controls which version of Lume and Lumocs should be used
and sets up the scripts to build your site. Here's an example configuration:

```json
{
  "tasks": {
    "lume": "echo \"import 'lume/cli.ts'\" | deno run --unstable -A -",
    "serve": "deno task lume -s --port=8000"
  },
  "imports": {
    "lume/": "https://deno.land/x/lume@v1.19.1/",
    "lumocs/": "https://deno.land/x/lumocs@0.0.16/"
  }
}
```

Make sure to match the import versions with the latest version off Lume and
Lumocs.

### `_config.ts`

In the `_config.ts` file, you'll set the public URL of your site to ensure the
sitemap displays complete URLs. Advanced users can also activate additional Lume
plugins here. Here's a basic configuration:

```typescript
import lume from "lume/mod.ts";
import lumocs from "lumocs/mod.ts";

const siteUrl = "https://url.of.site";

const site = lume({
  src: "src",
  location: new URL(siteUrl),
});

site.use(lumocs());

// OPTIONAL: site.copy("img")

export default site;
```

Note the commented-out line, which instructs Lumocs to copy the contents of an
`img` directory located within your `src/` folder to the resulting output
directory when your website is built. This step ensures that any images or
assets in the `img` directory are included in your documentation website.

### `src/_data.json`

Think of `src/_data.json` as the global configuration for your site. Parameters
in this file serve as the default front matter for each generated page. Here's
an example:

```json
{
  "lang": "en",
  "layout": "page.njk",

  "metas": {
    "title": "=title",
    "site": "Site Name",
    "lang": "en",
    "description": "=description"
  },

  "top_links": [
    {
      "icon": "fab fa-github",
      "title": "GitHub Repository",
      "url": "https://github.com/hexagon/lumocs"
    },
    {
      "icon": "fab fa-npm",
      "title": "NPM Library",
      "url": "https://npmjs.com"
    }
  ],

  "nav_links": [
    {
      "title": "GitHub Repository",
      "url": "https://github.com/hexagon/lumocs"
    },
    {
      "title": "NPM Library",
      "url": "https://npmjs.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `src/index.md`

Now, let's add your first content to `src/index.md`. This Markdown file serves
as the starting point for your documentation. Include the following front matter
and content:

```markdown
---
title: "First Page"
nav_order: 1
---

# First Page

Hello Lumocs!
```

### Compiling Your Site

When you're ready to compile your site for deployment, run the following
command:

```sh
deno task lume
```

This command will render your site into a new subfolder called `_site` within
your `/docs` directory. The `lume` command is especially useful for deploying
your site, and it's run automatically if you use the provided GitHub Pages
workflow.

### Deploying Your Site

Now you can either deploy your site manually, or utilize GitHub Pages.

There's an example workflow included at
[`/demo-repository/.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`](https://github.com/hexagon/lumocs/blob/main/demo-repository/.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml)
in the Lumocs GitHub repository. This workflow shows you how to set up GitHub
Actions to handle the deployment for you.

1. Copy the `deploy-pages.yml` from the
   [`/demo-repository/.github/workflows/`](https://github.com/hexagon/lumocs/tree/main/demo-repository/.github/workflows)
   directory to your project's `.github/workflows/` directory.
2. In your GitHub repository, navigate to `Settings`.
3. Under the `Pages` section, set the source to `GitHub Actions`.

This configuration will automatically build and deploy your site to GitHub Pages
whenever you push to your main branch.
