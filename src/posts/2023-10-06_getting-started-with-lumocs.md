## Why Lumocs?

### **Tailored Design and Layout**

Lumocs comes with a design and layout specifically crafted for documentation. It understands the unique requirements of presenting technical information, making your documentation not only informative but visually appealing.

### **Automatic Light/Dark Mode**

Lumocs offers automatic light/dark mode switching based on user preference. Your readers can enjoy your documentation in their preferred mode without writing a single line of code.

### **Zero Configuration Required**

One of Lumocs' standout features is its ease of use. You don't need to spend hours configuring settings or tweaking templates. Lumocs works great and looks great right out of the box. Simply set up your base configuration, plug in your content, and you're ready to go.

### **Using Markdown**

Lumocs generates your documentation website from Markdown files. It is based on `markdown-it`, allowing you to format your content precisely the way you want it.

### **Easy Customization**

While Lumocs is great out of the box, it also gives you the flexibility to customize it to suit your project's unique needs. You can easily tailor its appearance and functionality using `_data.json` for simple customization, and the `_includes` folder for more advanced use cases where you add extra content to the layout, or override the Lumocs templates.

### **Mobile-Responsive Design**

Lumocs ensures that your documentation looks great and functions seamlessly on mobile devices, ensuring accessibility for all.

### **GitHub Pages Ready**

For those looking for a hassle-free deployment solution, Lumocs is ready for GitHub Pages. A sample workflow is included.

### **Modern Technologies**

Lumocs doesn't rely on outdated technologies. It's built with Deno and Lume, which is modern tools without bloat and heavy legacy. If you are a JavaScript or TypeScript developer at heart, you should immediately switch from Jekyll which is written in Ruby.

## Getting Started

Are you eager to get started with Lumocs and creating nice looking documentation for your project? You're in the right place! This guide will walk you through the essential steps to set up Lumocs, create your first documentation page, and deploy your site.

### Prerequisites

Before we jump into Lumocs, ensure you have Deno installed on your system. Lumocs requires Deno version 1.37 or higher to function correctly. If you haven't installed Deno yet, follow the [official instructions](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation) to get it up and running.

## Organizing Your Files

To make your Lumocs project structured and manageable, it's recommended to organize your files as follows:

```
/                          # Your repository root
├── /docs                  # The documentation folder
│   ├── _config.ts         # Lume configuration file
│   ├── deno.json          # Deno configuration file
│   └── /src               # Documentation source
│       ├── _data.json     # Global variables
│       ├── index.md       # Documentation index, will become index.html
│       └── <other pages>  # Additional documentation pages
```

In this structure, all Lumocs-related files are placed within the `/docs` subfolder. The actual content and global variables are located in the `/docs/src` subfolder.

## Adding The Essential Files

### `deno.json`

The `deno.json` file controls which version of Lume and Lumocs should be used and sets up the scripts to build your site. Here's an example configuration:

```json
{
  "tasks": {
    "lume": "echo \"import 'lume/cli.ts'\" | deno run --unstable -A -",
    "serve": "deno task lume -s --port=8000"
  },
  "imports": {
    "lume/": "https://deno.land/x/lume@v1.19.1/",
    "lumocs/": "https://deno.land/x/lumocs@0.0.16/"
  }
}
```

Make sure to match the import versions with the latest version off Lume and Lumocs.

### `_config.ts`

In the `_config.ts` file, you'll set the public URL of your site to ensure the sitemap displays complete URLs. Advanced users can also activate additional Lume plugins here. Here's a basic configuration:

```typescript
import lume from "lume/mod.ts";
import lumocs from "lumocs/mod.ts";

const siteUrl = "https://url.of.site";

const site = lume({
  src: "src",
  location: new URL(siteUrl),
});

site.use(lumocs());

export default site;
```

### `src/_data.json`

Think of `src/_data.json` as the global configuration for your site. Parameters in this file serve as the default front matter for each generated page. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "lang": "en",
  "layout": "page.njk",

  "metas": {
    "title": "=title",
    "site": "Site Name",
    "lang": "en",
    "description": "=description"
  },

  "top_links": [
    {
      "icon": "fab fa-github",
      "title": "GitHub Repository",
      "url": "https://github.com/hexagon/lumocs"
    },
    {
      "icon": "fab fa-npm",
      "title": "NPM Library",
      "url": "https://npmjs.com"
    }
  ],

  "nav_links": [
    {
      "title": "GitHub Repository",
      "url": "https://github.com/hexagon/lumocs"
    },
    {
      "title": "NPM Library",
      "url": "https://npmjs.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `src/index.md`

Now, let's add your first content to `src/index.md`. This Markdown file serves as the starting point for your documentation. Include the following front matter and content:

```markdown
---
title: "First Page"
nav_order: 1
---

# First Page

Hello Lumocs!
```

## Generating Your Site

You're now equipped with the essential files and content. It's time to see Lumocs in action.

### Serving Your Site Locally

To serve your site locally with hot reload, navigate to the documentation root (the `/docs` folder in this example) and run the following command:

```sh
deno task serve
```

This command launches a local server, and you can access your live site at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### Compiling Your Site

When you're ready to compile your site for deployment, run the following command:

```sh
deno task lume
```

This command will render your site into a new subfolder called `_site` within your `/docs` directory. The `lume` command is especially useful for deploying your site, and it's run automatically if you use the provided GitHub Pages workflow.

### Deploying Your Site

Now you can either deploy your site manually, or utilize GitHub Pages. 

There's an example workflow included at
[`/demo-repository/.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`](https://github.com/hexagon/lumocs/blob/main/demo-repository/.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml)
in the Lumocs GitHub repository. This workflow shows you how to set up GitHub
Actions to handle the deployment for you.

1. Copy the `deploy-pages.yml` from the
   [`/demo-repository/.github/workflows/`](https://github.com/hexagon/lumocs/tree/main/demo-repository/.github/workflows)
   directory to your project's `.github/workflows/` directory.
2. In your GitHub repository, navigate to `Settings`.
3. Under the `Pages` section, set the source to `GitHub Actions`.

This configuration will automatically build and deploy your site to GitHub Pages
whenever you push to your main branch.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've taken your first steps with Lumocs. You now have the foundation in place to create and manage your documentation effortlessly.
