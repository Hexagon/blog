## Introduction

In a previous article, we touched the basics of debugging using `console.log()`
and `console.error()`. But debugging is more than that. As your projects grow in
complexity, you'll need a broader set of tools and techniques to handle errors
and debug effectively.

## Understanding Types of Errors

### Syntax Errors

Syntax errors are straightforward: the code won't even run if there's a syntax
issue.

```javascript
let name = "John";
```

### Runtime Errors

These errors occur while the program is running.

```javascript
let x = undefinedVariable;
```

### Logical Errors

Logical errors are tricky because the code runs without any issues, but it
doesn't behave as expected. Here's an example to demonstrate this. Let's say
you're writing a function to calculate the average of an array of numbers.

```javascript
function calculateAverage(numbers) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i <= numbers.length; i++) {
    sum += numbers[i];
  }
  return sum / numbers.length;
}

const avg = calculateAverage([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
console.log("Average:", avg);
```

Here, the loop goes from 0 to numbers.length instead of numbers.length - 1. This
won't throw any runtime or syntax errors, but the function will return the wrong
average because numbers[numbers.length] is undefined.

## Advanced `console` Functions

### `console.table()`

Displays tabular data as a table.

```javascript
console.table([{ name: "John", age: 30 }, { name: "Jane", age: 25 }]);
```

### `console.group()` and `console.groupEnd()`

Group related messages together.

```javascript
console.group("User Details");
console.log("Name: John");
console.log("Age: 30");
console.groupEnd();
```

### `console.time()` and `console.timeEnd()`

Time how long an operation takes.

```javascript
console.time("Array initialize");
let arr = new Array(1000000);
console.timeEnd("Array initialize");
```

## Error Handling Mechanisms

### Using `try-catch` with Async/Await

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("some/api/endpoint");
    const data = await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("API fetch failed:", error);
  }
}
```

### Listening for Unhandled Promise Rejections

```javascript
window.addEventListener("unhandledrejection", function (event) {
  console.error("Unhandled Promise Rejection:", event);
});
```

## Debugging Best Practices

### Use Version Control

Use a version control system like Git. If a bug appears, you can easily roll
back to a previous working state.

### Code Reviews

Peer reviews can catch errors and bad practices before they become part of the
codebase.

## Conclusion

Advanced error handling and debugging are essential for writing maintainable,
robust JavaScript code. Whether you're working in the browser or on the server,
these techniques will make your life easier.
