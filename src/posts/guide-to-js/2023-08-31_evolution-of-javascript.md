title: The Evolution of JavaScript and Why It Matters
part: 7

Understanding the past and how we got here can give us good hints about where we're going. Let's dig into JavaScript's history and how it's grown over time. Knowing this stuff will help us when we move on to more complicated topics like Promises, async/await, and the latest JavaScript features.

## How Did JavaScript Start?

JavaScript was created back in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape. It was meant to be a simple language to add interactivity to websites. Eich put together the first version in just 10 days. Since then, the language has grown to be super important for web development, right next to HTML and CSS.

## ECMAScript: The Rule Book

ECMAScript is the set of rules that JavaScript follows. The group that came up with these rules, ECMA International, first put them out in 1997. We've had several updates to ECMAScript since then, adding new features and improving the language.

### Big Changes Over Time

- **ES3 (1999):** Gave us features like `try` and `catch` for handling errors.
  
- **ES5 (2009):** Added methods to work with JSON data and new ways to deal with objects.

- **ES6 / ES2015:** Big update that added `let` and `const`, arrow functions, and more.

- **ES2016 and after:** Smaller updates that bring in a couple of new things each year, like async/await in 2017 and optional chaining (`?.`) in 2020.

## How ECMAScript Affects Us Now

Many of the modern ways we use JavaScript come from updates to ECMAScript. For example:

- **Promises and async/await:** Make dealing with asynchronous code easier. These came in ES6 and ES2017.

- **Destructuring and Spread/Rest Operator:** Make it easier to work with lists and objects. These were added in ES6.

```javascript
	// Destructuring
	const [first, second] = [1, 2];
	
	// Spread/Rest Operator
	const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
	const moreNumbers = [...numbers, 4, 5];
```

## Keep Learning and Stay Current

It's important to keep up with the latest changes to ECMAScript. New features not only add new abilities but can also make your code run faster and be more secure. So, make it a habit to read official documentation and try out new stuff.

## Why Polyfills Aren't as Important Anymore

There was a time when we had to use lots of third-party packages and code snippets called polyfills to make sure our JavaScript worked on different browsers. This often made our code more complicated than it needed to be.

```javascript
	// Polyfill for Array.prototype.includes in older environments
	if (!Array.prototype.includes) {
		Array.prototype.includes = function(element) {
			// implementation here
		};
	}
```

These days, thanks to more consistent browser support and ECMAScript updates, we usually don't need these workarounds anymore.

## CommonJS to ES Modules: Time to Switch

CommonJS was the go-to way to include modules in JavaScript, especially in Node.js. But it had its limits. Now we're moving to ES modules, which are more flexible and better aligned with ECMAScript rules.

```javascript
// CommonJS
const fs = require('fs');

// ES Modules
import fs from 'fs';
```

Switching to ES modules will make your code cleaner and easier to manage, especially as you work on larger projects. It also optimizes for both static analysis and tree shaking. This can lead to better-optimized bundles and cleaner codebases, making it easier to get rid of outdated dependencies and polyfills.

## Why It's Important to Know This Before Advancing

Before we dive into advanced topics like classes, closures, and scopes, understanding the evolutionary landscape of JavaScript offers several benefits:

 * **Context**: Knowing why certain features were introduced or deprecated provides context, making it easier to understand their use-cases.
 * **Cleaner Code**: Understanding the latest features helps write cleaner, more efficient code, reducing reliance on outdated packages and polyfills.
 * **Optimized Performance**: Modern ECMAScript features are generally optimized for performance. Using them can offer speed benefits and better user experience.
 * **Future-proofing**: Staying updated with the current best practices and standards ensures that your code is easier to maintain and less likely to break in future environments.

Getting a sense of how JavaScript has evolved sets us up well for diving into more advanced topics. It helps us make smarter choices in how we write our code, making it easier to maintain, quicker to run, and more secure.
