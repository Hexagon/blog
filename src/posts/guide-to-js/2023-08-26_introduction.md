```javascript
const text = "Welcome to the first chapter of my JavaScript series!";
console.log(text);
```

I’m Hexagon. I’ve been coding front-end JavaScript since its early days and
jumped into back-end and library development with the rise of Node.js. Nowadays,
I’m all about Deno; it’s got all the developer experience built right in, making
it purely awesome to work with.

So, whether you’re just starting out in web development or you’re a seasoned
developer looking for a refresher, you’re in the right spot. The goal of this
series is to give you a solid and extensive understanding of JavaScript and its
features.

A selection of the topics you'll read about:

- **Strings and Numbers**: Learn how to manipulate text and numbers in
  JavaScript, from simple operations to advanced techniques.
- **Arrays and Objects**: Discover how to store and access data in JavaScript
  using arrays and objects, two of the most common data structures.
- **Functions and Classes**: Understand how to create and use functions and
  classes in JavaScript, which are essential for organizing and reusing code.
- **Promises and Async/Await**: Explore how to handle asynchronous code in
  JavaScript using promises and async/await, which are key for working with
  APIs, databases, and other external sources.

And much more!

**Note**: Some of these topics, like `Strings and Numbers` contain everything
from very simple to very advanced concepts, so you might want to read through
the guide more than once, going deeper into the articles each time.

Let’s get started!

## JavaScript: A Universal Language

One of the most striking features of JavaScript is its versatility. It can run
both on the user-facing part (frontend) and the data-processing part (backend)
of web applications. So, whether you're creating animated elements on a website
or setting up a robust server, JavaScript has got you covered. Best of all, the
basic concepts stay the same across different uses, making your skillset
transferable.

## Frontend vs. Backend

JavaScript is often associated with the dynamic and interactive elements you see
on websites—that's the frontend. But thanks to platforms like Node.js and Deno,
JavaScript has also made a name for itself in backend development.

What's great is that the core elements of the language stay consistent whether
you're working on the frontend or backend. While each environment has its own
specific tools and libraries, the basics apply everywhere.

## Where Do We Start?

This series aims to provide a smooth learning curve, no matter where you plan to
use JavaScript. We'll cover basics that can be run in:

1. **Browsers**: Just press F12, navigate to the 'Console' tab, and you can run
   your JavaScript code there.
2. **Node.js**: Offers server-side capabilities with a huge ecosystem of
   libraries.
3. **Deno**: Similar to Node.js, but offers additional features and improved
   security.

Choose your preferred environment for the examples.

## Our First Dive into JavaScript

Here's a simple JavaScript snippet demonstrating basic features like
**Variables**, **Comments**, and **Console Logging**. We'll cover these in depth
in future articles.

```javascript
// Declaring a variable named 'greeting' and assigning it a string value
let greeting = "Hello, World!";

// Logging the value of the variable to the console
console.log(greeting);
```

When you run this code, you'll see the output `Hello, World!` displayed.

1. **In the Browser**: Open the browser, press `F12`, paste the code into the
   console, and hit enter.
2. **In Node or Deno**: Save the code into a file, say `example.js`, and run it
   using `node example.js` or `deno run example.js` respectively.

Congratulations! You've just written and run your first JavaScript code that
works across multiple platforms.

## What's Next?

We're just scratching the surface here. Moving forward, we'll delve into more
complex topics, ensuring that our examples work seamlessly across all
environments.

Stay tuned for more and happy coding!
