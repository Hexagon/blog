Welcome to the first chapter of my JavaScript series! Whether you're just starting out in web development or you're a seasoned developer looking for a refresher, you're in the right spot.

I'm Hexagon. I've been coding front-end JavaScript since its early days and jumped into back-end development with the rise of Node.js. Nowadays, I'm all about Deno; it's got all the developer experience built right in, making it a joy to work with. I've contributed to a bunch of Node.js and Deno libraries, and you might even have stumbled upon some of my open-source projects.

This series is your roadmap to becoming a JavaScript expert. From the basics to the complex, I've got you covered. My goal is to give you a solid grasp of one of the most versatile and popular languages in the tech scene today.

## JavaScript: A Universal Language

One of the most striking features of JavaScript is its versatility. It can run both on the user-facing part (frontend) and the data-processing part (backend) of web applications. So, whether you're creating animated elements on a website or setting up a robust server, JavaScript has got you covered. Best of all, the basic concepts stay the same across different uses, making your skillset transferable.

## Frontend vs. Backend

JavaScript is often associated with the dynamic and interactive elements you see on websitesâ€”that's the frontend. But thanks to platforms like Node.js and Deno, JavaScript has also made a name for itself in backend development.

What's great is that the core elements of the language stay consistent whether you're working on the frontend or backend. While each environment has its own specific tools and libraries, the basics apply everywhere.

## Where Do We Start?

This series aims to provide a smooth learning curve, no matter where you plan to use JavaScript. We'll cover basics that can be run in:

1. **Browsers**: Just press F12, navigate to the 'Console' tab, and you can run
   your JavaScript code there.
2. **Node.js**: Offers server-side capabilities with a huge ecosystem of libraries.
3. **Deno**: Similar to Node.js, but offers additional features and improved security.

Choose your preferred environment for the examples.

## Our First Dive into JavaScript

Here's a simple JavaScript snippet demonstrating basic features like **Variables**, **Comments**, and **Console Logging**. We'll cover these in depth in future articles.

```javascript
// Declaring a variable named 'greeting' and assigning it a string value
let greeting = "Hello, World!";

// Logging the value of the variable to the console
console.log(greeting);
```

When you run this code, you'll see the output `Hello, World!` displayed.

1. **In the Browser**: Open the browser, press `F12`, paste the code into the
   console, and hit enter.
2. **In Node or Deno**: Save the code into a file, say `example.js`, and run it
   using `node example.js` or `deno run example.js` respectively.

Congratulations! You've just written and run your first JavaScript code that works across multiple platforms.

## What's Next?

We're just scratching the surface here. Moving forward, we'll delve into more complex topics, ensuring that our examples work seamlessly across all environments.

Stay tuned for more and happy coding!
