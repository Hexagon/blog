# SSH Key Management: Simplify Your Development Workflow

SSH keys provide an essential layer of security when working with remote servers, but they're often overlooked. In this guide, we'll walk through SSH key management, with a focus on making your development life simpler and more secure.

## Introduction

SSH keys are cryptographic keys that are used to authenticate users to servers, replacing the need for passwords. Not only are they more secure, but they also make the day-to-day work of developers more convenient. Imagine not having to remember and enter a password every time you push a commit!

Additionally, tools like Visual Studio Code support SSH key authentication, making coding remotely smooth and seamless.

## SSH Key Management for Windows 10/11

For those using Windows 10 or 11, here's a brief walk-through of setting up SSH key authentication:

### Step-by-step guide:

1. **Enable extra Windows features (Requires admin-shell)**

```Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client```

2. **Generate an SSH key pair**

```ssh-keygen```

3. **Start the ssh-agent in the background**

```ssh-agent -s```

4. **Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent**

```ssh-add ~\.ssh\id_rsa```

## SSH Key Management for Linux

For Linux users, here's a guide to setting up SSH key authentication:

### Step-by-step guide:

1. **Install OpenSSH client and server**

````sudo apt-get install openssh-client openssh-server```

2. **Generate an SSH key pair**

```ssh-keygen```

3. **Start the ssh-agent in the background**

```eval $(ssh-agent -s)```

4. **Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent**

```ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa```

## Disabling Password Authentication on the SSH Server

Once you have SSH keys set up, it's a good practice to disable password authentication on the SSH server for enhanced security:

### Step-by-step guide:

1. **Edit the SSH daemon configuration**

```sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config```

2. **Restart the SSH service**

```sudo systemctl restart sshd```
